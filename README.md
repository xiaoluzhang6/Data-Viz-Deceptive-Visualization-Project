# America's Gun Problem<br><br>
Firearm regulation  is one of the most talked about and controvertial topics. It brings up a lot of debate among different sides of the argument; The National Riffle Association for example, is an activist group very much against the increase of the level of firearm regulations. One of the biggest argument NRA brings up is the Second Amendment, where it describes the right for American citizens to bear arms. This contributed to the unique gun ownership and gun violence situation in the US; we are among the top developed countries to owning the most guns, as well has having one of the highest gun death rates (see source (1)). An example of a visualization that might be used by gun rights activist groups (such as NRA) might look like the one below:<br><br>
**Figure 1:**<br>

This figure shows the level of acceptance rate among the 50 states and the total number of death by guns in those states for the year 2015. The acceptance rate is caculated by taking the percentage of gun regulations passed by that state and the total number of gun regulations (133 in total). As observed, very liberal states (hereby refers to states which has comparatively fewer number of gun regulations)such as those in the mid-west (Montana, Utah, Kansas, South Dakota etc.) have very few gun-related deaths compared to those very conservative states (those with high number of passed gun regulations) such as California, and the Tristate area on the East Coast. Gun rights activist groups will argue that there is no direct/clear relationship between the gun laws passed and gun-related deaths. The inspiration of this visualization came from something very similar on the NRA's website __[here](https://www.nraila.org/gun-laws/)__ where states with very strict gun regulations are highlighted in a bright color. By using a map type visualization here, the audience would be able to contrast and compare the level of gun regulations between different states, as well as get a good idea of where gun deaths are the most serious. <br><br>

Figure 1 however, has an untold story. The death counts are in fact, absolute values and have not been normalized by taking state population into account. Taking a quick look at an similar visualization below (continental US) with death rate instead of total death count, we can see that the opposite is true; states with higher acceptance rate for gun regulations has a low death rate than those with lower acceptance rate. Note, death rate is calculated by taking number of deaths per 100,000 population total (see source (9)).<br>
**Figure 2:**<br>

From the above adjusted figure, we can see that the states in the mid-west now has a much bigger presence for gun deaths. However, the problem with Figure 2 is that although there is a observable relationship between gun regulation acceptance and gun deaths rate, the argument is made less obvious by the similar size of the death rates among the states. Viewer of the visualization may need to exert more effort in distinguishing between the states, especially those on the East Coast. To further illustrate the true effects on gun deaths rating of having a more strict set of gun laws, I came up with another version of the visualization below (using same sets of data):<br>

**Figure 3:**<br>
<img width="1045" alt="screen shot 2017-11-17 at 1 42 05 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32026039/32977723-d8ddcbd6-cbe7-11e7-96e0-b8d1b5bb97dd.png"><br>

For this version, I attempt to visualize the change in deaths rates for the states by taking the difference between death rate for 2015 and 2005, and then dividing by death rate of 2005. I am trying to show that states with higher acceptance rate for gun regulations will see a decreasing trend in gun deaths rate. California and the Tristate area now all have a negative death rate change (or no change in death rate) over the 10 years; the opposite could be said for the mid-west and southern. However, for Illinois and Hawaii (both with very high acceptance rate) there is an increase in death rate. This might be explained by the infamous mass shootings in the 2000’s, which are still very rare and random events. For Hawaii, the data might be put into more perspective by looking at the absolute death counts, which are very low to begin with; the rate of death rate will be distorted with a very small increase in death counts.<br>

### Discussion:<br>
Although both visualizations show a clear connection between gun regulations and gun related death, the reality is much more complicated. The US’s gun ownership situation is very unique in that it is often brought up in debates as related to a person’s right or freedom; a person has the right to purchase or carry firearms for the purpose of self protection and protection of their family/property. Take for example, Figure 1; the claim in this visualization could be used by NRA to lobby for gun rights. The warrant of the claim is that criminals and terrorists will use guns to hurt people and at the same time, guns in the hands of the right people can be used to protect others as well. The evidence is shown by the number of death counts for each state. A person might bring up a rebuttal that with more gun rights, it would be equally easy for criminals to obtain firearms and cause harm, but NRA has replied (see source(3)) with a study that reveals (although a very vague one) that  “firearms were used as often as 2.5 million times a year for protection--three to five times more often, than they are used for criminal purposes.” Here, the statistical fact could be taken from a pool of data ranging from 30 years or even longer. This is a common technique used by politicians or any sort of rights activist groups to pick and chose data that suitable for their needs. Another example of this is that the NRA goes onto incredible length and details in directing the second amendment, but uses very few words when addressing more current and relevant issues such as “why would anyone need semi-automatic assault rifle”, or gun registration. The focus is always on a person’s right or freedom rather than practical issues in regards to the huge number of gun-related deaths over the years, which does not seem to be slowing down at all. <br><br>

Although the first visualization, which is pro-gun rights, is misrepresenting data, it does give a powerful and a very straight forward argument that will invoke the audience into action. In combination with recent horrific mass shootings, the general public might be swayed into voting for political parties with a stance on loosening firearm regulations. After all, if the criminals and terrorists are armed to harm us, we should protect ourselves as well. Although we know this is not true (see study done in source 4 & 5), gun rights or regulations still remains one of central issues for the US’s political scene. The reason is that it is backed by a few very politically powerful and passionate minority groups (such as the NRA. See source 6.). One of the biggest claims NRA has for the need of gun rights is that gun will give protection when in the right hands; but there is data that shows majority of the time guns result in suicide deaths rather than homicide; this in itself will debunk NRA’s claim. Although people who is considering committing  suicide will try other methods if firearm is not available, they will have more time to reconsider and possibly get a second chance if they get revived; this will be impossible if a gun is used, as it happens fast, and it is most times fatal.

### Future Improvements/Additional Features:<br>
<img width="684" alt="screen shot 2017-11-17 at 7 33 41 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32026039/32977713-b51fb880-cbe7-11e7-8b15-a87116b60a73.png"><br>

This visualization shows the relationship between change in acceptance of firearm regulations and change in death rate. It is clear that there is actually no clear relationship between the two. What is clear is that there is a definite increase in the number of gun related deaths over the 10 year period. Keeping in mind that some of the states with increased rate in both have very little gun regulations to begin with (Alaska only had 4 gun regulations passed), it is still very disturbing to see gun deaths has not improved on overall. A possible future study would be to visualize data on gun owner ship and its relationship to death rates; from the above chart (and many current existing studies) it seems firearm regulations is not the main problem here; private ownership of guns is. Figure 2 could be improved by maybe mapping out different causes of death by firearms; this would debunk NRA’s claims that guns are used for protection and for law enforcement. In reality; without years of training or handling experience, a regular person would not be able respond in an emergency situation and put a gun to good use (see video __[here](https://youtu.be/8QjZY3WiO9s)__ ). Additional study could also be done to see the relationship between social/economic makeup of states and gun violence; populated urban areas with high levels of economic disparity have the tendency for attracting criminal activities, which potentially could lead to gun-related deaths. This kind of study could be useful for law makers to apply regulations targeting specific areas.<br><br>
